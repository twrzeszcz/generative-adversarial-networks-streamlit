# General info
The goal of this project was to generate images with *Generative Adversarial Networks*. Preprocessing of images and model training is done in the **gans** notebook. There are 4 models included which were trained on the following datasets [kaggle_coins](https://www.kaggle.com/wanderdust/coin-images), [kaggle_landscapes](https://www.kaggle.com/arnaud58/landscape-pictures), [kaggle_animals](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/animal-faces), [kaggle_fingers](https://www.kaggle.com/koryakinp/fingers). Image generator is deployed on the [Streamlit]() (currently offline).
